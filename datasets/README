Datasets:
Note: all datasets are also available on a Zenodo repository here, including the source data for all figures and the supplementary information: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14659968

  1.  The homo-oligomer PDB ids with the labels were downloaded from the PDB: https://www.rcsb.org/ 
      This labeled data and the train/val/test splits can be downloaded here: 
        http://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/seq2symm/datasets.zip

      The protein sequences corresponding to the PDB ids in homo-oligomer dataset can be obtained from: https://www.rcsb.org/
  
  2.  Test sets:
      The denovo and UniFold evaluation datasets are from prior published work and cited in the Supplementary material. The links to the publications from where these datasets were downloaded are below:
